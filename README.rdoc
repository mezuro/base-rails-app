=== Contributing

Please, have a look the wiki pages about development workflow and code standards:

* https://github.com/mezuro/mezuro/wiki/Development-workflow

=== Development


* System dependencies (Ubuntu 14.04 package names)

  * build-essential

  * curl

  * postgresql-server-dev-9.4

* Unpacked dependecies

  * PhantomJS >= 1.9.2 (http://phantomjs.org/)

  *NOTE:* Just create sym links for that

    cd /usr/local/share
    wget https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-1.9.7-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
    tar xjf phantomjs-1.9.7-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/phantomjs-1.9.7-linux-x86_64/bin/phantomjs /usr/local/share/phantomjs
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/phantomjs-1.9.7-linux-x86_64/bin/phantomjs /usr/local/bin/phantomjs
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/phantomjs-1.9.7-linux-x86_64/bin/phantomjs /usr/bin/phantomjs

* Ruby version

  2.2.0 

  You can easily install it through the Ruby Version Manager - RVM. Instructions on how to do it can be found at http://rvm.io

  *NOTE:* If you are using the gnome-shell, or any derivate like terminator, you have to mark on your profile the option to use a "login bash".


* Configuration

    bundle install

* Database creation

    rake db:create

* Database initialization

    rake db:setup

* How to run the test suite

    rake

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

  Kalibro Processor, Kalibro Configurations and Analizo are necessary to set up properly your environment.

  The clones of Kalibro processor and Kalibro configurations must be in the same directory of the Prezento.
  something like +mezuro/prezento+, +mezuro/kalibro_configurations+, +mezuro/kalibro_processor+.

  <b>Kalibro Processor</b>
  
  You can find it at https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro_processor
  By default Mezuro will expect it to be running on port 8082 at localhost.
  In order to run it as expected, run on two different terminal instances: ```RAILS_ENV=local rails s -p 8082```; and ```RAILS_ENV=local rake jobs:work```.

  <b>Kalibro Configurations</b>
  
  You can find it at https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro_configurations
  By default Mezuro will expect it to be running on port 8083 at localhost.
  In order to run it as expected, run on two different terminal instances: ```rails s -p 8083```.

  <b>Analizo</b>
  
  You can find it at https://github.com/analizo/analizo
  You have follow the steps of the INSTALL.md
  https://github.com/analizo/analizo/blob/master/INSTALL.md


* Deployment instructions

  Deployment is made through Capistrano (https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano)

    cap production deploy

  In order to do this, you must have the password.

  Otherwise, you can also modify the deployment file at <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt>.

=== Install

* First Deploy

  1. Make sure that the deployment file <tt>config/deploy.rb</tt> is correctly configured to the installation server;
  2. Also, make sure that the installation server already has rvm installed;
  3. <tt>cap deploy:setup</tt> will install the ruby correct ruby version, the gemset and all the directories tree;
