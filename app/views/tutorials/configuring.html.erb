<h2>Setting a New Configuration</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Requisites</h3>

In order to create a Configuration, you must:
<ul>
  <li>Have <%= link_to("signed up", new_user_registration_path) %> to the platform</li>
  <li>Be <%= link_to("signed in", new_user_session_path) %></li>
  <li>Have already created at least one Reading Group</li>
</ul>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

To process a repository, Mezuro uses configurations which you specify on the <%= link_to "repository creation", tutorials_path('analyzing') %>. Here you will be briefly introduced to all the components of a configuration and then guided through the steps to create one.

<h4>Configuration components</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Configuration</b>: just a high level container for the remaining components association</li>
  <li><b>Metrics</b>: specification of which metric will be calculated during the processing and how to interpret its results</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Weight: for each module is given a grade which is a weighted average of all the metrics calculated for it. This field is the weight of the metric on the final grade</li>
      <li>Aggregation Form: Not all the metrics can be calculated for every module. For this type of metric, we calculate the aggregation of the children values accordingly to what this field specifies</li>
      <li>Reading Group: specifies which set of interpretations (called readings) will be available for this metric</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Reading Group</b>: just a high level container for the readings (interpretations)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Reading: interpretation for a given value providing label, grade (this is the grade used for the weighted average mentioned above) and color</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Range</b>: Associates number intervals to the readings of a given metric</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Configuration creation</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Click on "Configuration" on the upper menu</li>
    <li>Click on "New Configuration"</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill in the form with a name that must be unique</li>
      <li>Fill in the form with a description which is not required</li>
      <li>Click on "Save" and you should be at the configuration page now</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Metric addition</li>
  <ol>
    <li>From the configuration page</li>
    <li>Click on "Add Metric"</li>
    <li>Select one collector from the accordions, and click on the metric that you want to add</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill in the form with a "Weight", used to calculate the final grade</li>
      <li>Select the "Aggregation Form" that will be used for this metric</li>
      <li>Select the "Reading Group" which will provide the interpretations for this metric</li>
      <li>Click on "Save" and you should be at the configuration page now with the new metric added</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Ranges creation</li>
  <ol>
    <li>From the configuration page</li>
    <li>Click on "Show" for the metric which you want to create ranges to</li>
    <li>Click on "Add Range"</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill in the form with the "Beginning" and "End" values for the interval</li>
      <li>Fill in the form with the "Comments" which will be displayed if the metric value matches the interval</li>
      <li>Select the "Reading" which will be associated with this range</li>
      <li>Click on "Save" and you should be at the metric page now with the new range added, congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
